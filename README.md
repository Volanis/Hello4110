2 cups of pineapple juice
4 cups of sugar

Melt 1 lb of butter, molasses, and brown sugar together and boil while stirring until mixture is smooth. Pour mixture in a sprayed pan
and place slices of pineapple evenly in the caramel. Place pan in a refridgerator or freezer to cool.

Soften remaining butter and add to a mixing bowl. Using a slow setting begin mixing the butter until it spread across the mixing bowl and add each egg individually until each is mixed with the butter. Add the sour cream, pineapple juice, and sugar individually until each is mixed, scrapping the bowl after all ingredients are added to ensure it is mixed well. Add the high gluten flour, cake flour, almond extract, vanilla, baking powder, and salt in that order, mixing each well before adding the next ingredient.

Add batter to cooled pan with caramel and bake for 2 hours at 300 degrees. Allow pan to cool to just below room temperature and flip into a new pan.
